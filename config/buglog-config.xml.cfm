	<!-- Environment-specific Settings: 
		
		You can override any of the above settings for specific environments. 
		
		The environment can be given in any of the following ways:
		
			1. Create a file named "serverkey.txt" on the same directory as this config file.
				This file should contain only a single word to use as the environment name (i.e. "dev", "production1", "test", etc)
			2. Create a servlet context parameter named "serverkey" with the value you want to use for your environment
				In Tomcat, this would be done by editing the file {TOMCAT_HOME}/conf/context.xml
				and adding a line like:
					 <Parameter name="serverkey" value="someNameHere" override="false" />
			3. Pass the environment name using the configKey argument to the init() method on config.cfc whenever is created
			4. Pass the path to a file containing the environment key to config.cfc
			
		NOTE: the first two methods are way more easier and portable since there are at least 3 places where the config.cfc object is created
			and you would need to update all three if you use method #3 or #4
		
		NOTE 2: If you are using methods #1 or #2, you can change the value of the filename or the context parameter
			by editing /bugLog/components/xmlConfigProvider.cfc, lines 6 and 9.
